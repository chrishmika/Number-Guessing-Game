I developed an interactive Number Guessing Game web application from scratch, designed as a single page application (SPA) utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This engaging and user-friendly game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, providing real-time feedback on their guesses.

**Key Features:**

  • Responsive Design: Ensured compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
  • Dynamic User Interface: Leveraged JavaScript to create a seamless and intuitive gaming experience without page reloads.
  • Styled Components: Applied modern CSS techniques for a clean and visually appealing layout.
  • Input Validation: Implemented robust error handling to guide users and enhance gameplay.
